Use margin and padding to space your elements in a visually pleasing way.
Use at least one of each of the following types of selectors: element, class, id.
Don't break these rules:
At all costs, avoid adding HTML elements in order to achieve a specific visual effect.
Use document-level and inline styles sparingly, and only when absolutely necessary.
As before, be creative! Make your page look great, and don't settle for checking off
the items above. Have a look at CSS Zen Garden for inspiration (use your browser's
developer tools to see how those pages' styles are built).
